## koawalib-template
The purpose of this repo is to lower the learning curve of koawalib...
(and make it easier on me when I create new repos lol)  

### Usage
Simply clone this repository to use the standard version of koawalib, published through Jitpack.  

### Local koawalib module
If you want to modify the koawalib source code/have instant updates through git, follow these steps.  
This will setup koawalib as a local repository, and as a dependency to your fork.   
When new updates are pushed to koawalib, the user can choose how/when to upgrade through git.
 
1. Clone this repository
2. Clone [koawalib](https://github.com/AsianKoala/koawalib) in the same parent directory
3. cd into the directory
4. Merge with the local-koawalib branch of this repository
5. Remove this repo as a remote
6. Add your own repo as a remote
7. Push and set your repo's master branch as upstream

Here is an example of me following the above steps with my personal repository.

```
git clone git@github.com:AsianKoala/koawalib-template.git PP-Public
git clone git@github.com:AsianKoala/koawalib.git
cd PP-Public
git merge origin/local-koawalib
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:ftc-noteam/PP-Public.git
git push -u origin master
```
